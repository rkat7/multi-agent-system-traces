If the field `K` is not exact, it tries to convert the polynomials to an exact field and then calls `dup_inner_gcd` again with the exact field.\n2. If `K` is a field, it uses either a heuristic GCD algorithm or the PRS (polynomial remainder sequence) algorithm to compute the GCD.\n3. If `K` is not a field, it uses the PRS algorithm to compute the GCD.\nThe `dup_inner_gcd` function does not seem to have any special handling for factors with the same multiplicity. It simply computes the GCD of the input polynomials and returns the GCD, as well as the cofactors.\nTo understand the root cause of the inconsistent output in the `sqf_list` function, we may need to look deeper into the `dup_sqf_list` function and the way it uses the `dup_inner_gcd` function to decompose the polynomial into square-free factors.\nFinal Answer: Based on the analysis of the `dup_inner_gcd` function, the inconsistent output in the `sqf_list` function is likely not caused by this function. The issue might be in the way the `dup_sqf_list` function processes the factors with the same multiplicity. Further investigation of the `dup_sqf_list` implementation might be necessary to identify the root cause of the problem.",
