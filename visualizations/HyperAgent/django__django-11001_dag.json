However, the issue appears to be that this deduplication process is too simplistic and does not properly handle multiline RawSQL expressions.\nTo resolve this issue, it seems that the `get_order_by()` method needs to be modified to handle multiline RawSQL expressions more robustly, potentially by using a more sophisticated regular expression or by processing the SQL in a different way.\nFinal Answer:\n1. Examine the implementation of the `get_order_by()` method in more detail to understand how it handles different types of order-by expressions, including multiline RawSQL expressions.\n2. Consider modifying the regular expression `self.ordering_parts` to better handle multiline SQL strings, or explore alternative approaches to deduplicating order-by clauses.\n3. Potentially add a unit test or integration test to reproduce the issue and verify the fix, to ensure that the behavior is properly addressed.\n4. If necessary, submit a pull request to the Django project with the proposed changes, along with a detailed explanation of the issue and the approach taken to resolve it.\nThe key is to thoroughly investigate the existing code, understand the problem, and then implement a robust solution that addresses the issue without introducing new bugs or regressions.",

The method processes the `query.order_by` and `query.extra_order_by` attributes to build the ORDER BY clause.\n2. It checks if the order by expressions are referencing annotations or extra select clauses, and handles them accordingly.\n3. It maintains a `seen` set to keep track of the order by expressions that have already been processed, to avoid duplicates.\nThe issue seems to be related to the way the method handles multiline RawSQL expressions in the ORDER BY clause. The method appears to be comparing only the last line of the RawSQL expression to detect duplicates, which leads to the incorrect removal of some order by clauses.\nTo resolve this issue, the method may need to be modified to handle multiline RawSQL expressions more robustly, potentially by considering the full expression instead of just the last line.\nFinal Answer:\nThe issue described in the GitHub report is caused by a limitation in the `get_order_by()` method of the `SQLCompiler` class in the Django ORM. The method compares the last line of RawSQL expressions in the ORDER BY clause to detect duplicates, which leads to incorrect removal of some order by clauses when dealing with multiline RawSQL expressions.\nTo resolve this issue, the `get_order_by()` method would need to be modified to handle multiline RawSQL expressions more robustly, potentially by considering the full expression instead of just the last line. This would ensure that the method correctly identifies and preserves all the necessary order by clauses, even when they are expressed using multiline RawSQL statements.",

It then checks if this ordering part has already been seen before, and if so, it skips adding that order by clause to the final result.\nThe issue seems to be that when dealing with multiline SQL expressions like the `RawSQL` examples provided in the GitHub issue, the regular expression is not correctly handling the newline characters, and is potentially identifying the order by clauses as duplicates when they are not.\nTo solve this issue, the code may need to be updated to handle multiline SQL expressions more robustly, potentially by cleaning up the SQL string before applying the regular expression, as suggested in the GitHub issue.\nFinal Answer: The root cause of the issue is in the `get_order_by()` method of the `SQLCompiler` class in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file. The method uses a regular expression to identify duplicate order by clauses, but it does not handle multiline SQL expressions like the `RawSQL` examples provided in the GitHub issue correctly.\nThe suggested fix is to clean up the SQL string before applying the regular expression, for example by joining the lines into a single line, as shown in the following code snippet:\n```python\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\n```\nThis should ensure that the regular expression correctly identifies the order by clauses, and prevents the incorrect removal of order by clauses.",

Modifying the `self.ordering_parts` regular expression to capture the entire ordering clause, including CASE statements.\nThese changes should resolve the issue with incorrect removal of order_by clauses created as multiline RawSQL. The tests related to ordering have passed, indicating that the modifications haven't introduced any obvious regressions.\nTo fully validate the fix, it would be advisable to test it with the specific use case mentioned in the original issue description, using multiline RawSQL statements in the order_by clause. Additionally, a more comprehensive test suite covering various edge cases with multiline SQL and complex ordering clauses should be developed to ensure the robustness of this solution.",

The method first checks the various sources of ordering information, such as `query.extra_order_by`, `query.order_by`, `query.get_meta().ordering`, etc.\n2. It then processes each ordering expression, handling different cases like referring to an annotation, using a `RawSQL` expression, etc.\n3. The method also deals with handling ordering in the context of combined queries (e.g., `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, etc.).\n4. It deduplicates ordering expressions to avoid adding the same expression twice.\nTo resolve the issue described in the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem is related to the way the `get_order_by()` method handles multiline `RawSQL` expressions. The method currently relies on a regular expression (`self.ordering_parts`) to extract the last line of the `RawSQL` expression, which may not work correctly in all cases.\nA potential solution could be to modify the `get_order_by()` method to handle multiline `RawSQL` expressions more robustly, perhaps by treating them as a single expression instead of trying to split them up. This could involve changes to the regular expression used or the overall logic for processing ordering expressions.\nFinal Answer:\nThe issue seems to be related to the way the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()` method handles multiline `RawSQL` expressions in the `ORDER BY` clause of SQL queries. A possible solution could be to modify the method to treat multiline `RawSQL` expressions as a single expression, rather than trying to split them up using a regular expression. This could involve changes to the regular expression used or the overall logic for processing ordering expressions in the method.",

When this entire method\n# is refactored into expressions, then we can check each part as we\n# generate it.\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nparams_hash = make_hashable(params)\nif (without_ordering, params_hash) in seen:\ncontinue\nseen.add((without_ordering, params_hash))\n```\nThis code is responsible for deduplicating the order by clauses in the SQL query. It uses a regular expression (`self.ordering_parts`) to extract the column name from the order by SQL, and then checks if that column has already been added to the `seen` set. If so, it skips adding that order by clause.\nThe issue with this implementation is that it only looks at the last line of the SQL statement, which can lead to incorrect deduplication when dealing with multiline SQL statements like the one provided in the issue description.\nFinal Answer:\nTo fix the issue with the incorrect removal of order_by clauses when dealing with multiline RawSQL statements, the `get_order_by()` method in the `SQLCompiler` class from the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file could be modified as follows:\n```python\ndef get_order_by(self):\n# ... (existing code)\nresult = []\nseen = set()\nfor expr, is_ref in order_by:\nresolved = expr.resolve_expression(self.query, allow_joins=True, reuse=None)\nsql, params = self.compile(resolved)\n# Split the SQL statement by newline and check each line individually for deduplication\nlines = sql.split('\\n')\nfor line in lines:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(line).group(1)\nparams_hash = make_hashable(params)\nif (without_ordering, params_hash) in seen:\ncontinue\nseen.add((without_ordering, params_hash))\nresult.append((resolved, (line, params, is_ref)))\nreturn result\n```\nThe key changes are:\n1. Split the SQL statement by newline characters using `sql.split('\\n')`.\n2. Check each line individually for deduplication using the `self.ordering_parts.search(line).group(1)` to extract the column name.\n3. Add the extracted column name and the `params_hash` to the `seen` set to track the unique order by clauses.\nThis modified `get_order_by()` method should handle the issue with multiline RawSQL statements more robustly and correctly deduplicate the order by clauses.",

Specifically, the method uses a regular expression (`self.ordering_parts.search(sql)`) to extract the last line of the SQL expression, which is used to identify duplicate order by clauses. However, this approach may not work correctly when the SQL expression spans multiple lines, as the regular expression may not capture the entire expression correctly.\nTo address this issue, a possible solution could be to modify the `get_order_by()` method to handle multiline RawSQL expressions more robustly. One approach could be to use a more sophisticated parsing mechanism, such as a SQL parser, to ensure that the entire SQL expression is properly captured and compared, rather than relying on regular expressions.\nAnother potential solution could be to modify the way the RawSQL expressions are constructed in the Django ORM, to ensure that they are always single-line expressions, or to provide a way for the user to indicate that a RawSQL expression should be treated as a single unit, rather than having its individual lines compared separately.\nUltimately, the best solution will depend on the specific implementation details of the Django ORM and the `SQLCompiler` class, as well as the broader context of the project and the expected use cases for the RawSQL feature.\nFinal Answer:\nThe issue described in the GitHub report appears to be related to the way the `get_order_by()` method in the `SQLCompiler` class handles multiline RawSQL expressions.

A new `normalize_sql()` function has been added at the beginning of the file to handle multiline SQL statements.\n2. The `get_order_by()` method now uses the `normalize_sql()` function to normalize the SQL before applying the regular expression.\n3. The normalized SQL is used for identifying duplicate clauses, ensuring that multiline RawSQL statements are handled correctly.\nThese changes should fix the issue while maintaining the existing functionality for other cases. The solution addresses the concerns raised in the GitHub issue and should provide a more robust handling of order_by clauses, especially for multiline RawSQL expressions.",

This solution should resolve the problem described in the original GitHub issue.\nTo summarize the changes:\n1. A new `normalize_sql()` function has been added at the beginning of the file to handle multiline SQL statements.\n2. The `get_order_by()` method now uses the `normalize_sql()` function to normalize the SQL before applying the regular expression.\n3. The normalized SQL is used for identifying duplicate clauses, ensuring that multiline RawSQL statements are handled correctly.\nThese changes should fix the issue while maintaining the existing functionality for other cases. The solution addresses the concerns raised in the GitHub issue and should provide a more robust handling of order_by clauses, especially for multiline RawSQL expressions.",

The `self.ordering_parts` regular expression is used to extract the ordering expression without the `ASC` or `DESC` suffix.\n2. The `without_ordering` variable is set to the result of applying the `self.ordering_parts` regex to the SQL expression.\n3. The method then checks if the `(without_ordering, params_hash)` pair has already been seen in the `seen` set. If so, it skips adding the ordering expression to the result.\nThis is the code snippet that implements this logic:\n```python\ndef get_order_by(self):\n# ...\nfor resolved, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:\n# ...\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nparams_hash = make_hashable(params)\nif (without_ordering, params_hash) in seen:\ncontinue\nseen.add((without_ordering, params_hash))\nresult.append((resolved, (sql, params, is_ref)))\nreturn result\n```\nThe issue described in the GitHub post is that this logic fails to correctly handle multiline SQL expressions in the ORDER BY clause, leading to the removal of some ordering clauses.\nFinal Answer: The root cause of the issue is in the `get_order_by()` method of the `SQLCompiler` class, specifically the part that uses the `self.ordering_parts` regular expression to extract the ordering expression without the `ASC` or `DESC` suffix. This regular expression fails to correctly handle multiline SQL expressions, leading to the removal of some ordering clauses.\nThe proposed solution is to modify the regular expression or the way the SQL expression is processed to better handle multiline SQL expressions in the ORDER BY clause.",
