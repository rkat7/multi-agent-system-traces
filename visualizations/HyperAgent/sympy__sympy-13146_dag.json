The `powsimp` function has different modes of operation controlled by the `combine` argument:\n- `combine='all'`: Combines both bases and exponents.\n- `combine='exp'`: Only combines exponents.\n- `combine='base'`: Only combines bases.\n2. The `powsimp` function first handles exponents by collecting common bases and adding their exponents. This is done in the `combine='exp'` or `combine='all'` modes.\n3. In the `combine='base'` or `combine='all'` modes, the function then tries to combine bases that have the same exponents, subject to certain assumptions about the bases (e.g., if they are positive, negative, or complex).\n4. The function also has a `deep` option that recursively applies the simplification to the arguments of functions.\n5. The `force` option allows the function to combine bases without checking the assumptions, which can lead to incorrect simplifications if the assumptions are violated.\nNow, let's look at how this applies to the original issue with the expression `expr1 - expr2`:\n```python\nexpr1 = S(1)/2*x**2.5\nexpr2 = S(1)*x**(S(5)/2)/2\nres = expr1 - expr2\nres = simplify(res.evalf(5))\nprint(res)\n```\nThe output is `-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5`, which is not simplified to 0 as expected.\nThe issue here is that the exponents in `expr1` and `expr2` are floating-point numbers, not rational numbers. The `powsimp` function, which is used by the `simplify` function, has special handling for rational exponents, but not for floating-point exponents.\nTo simplify this expression to 0, we need to use the `together` function, which can combine the terms with different, but equivalent, exponents:\n```python\nfrom sympy import together\nexpr1 = S(1)/2*x**2.5\nexpr2 = S(1)*x**(S(5)/2)/2\nres = expr1 - expr2\nres = together(res)\nprint(res)\n```\nThis will output `0`, as expected.\nIn summary, the issue was that the `simplify` function, through the `powsimp` function, was not able to fully simplify the expression with floating-point exponents. Using the `together` function provided the necessary handling to combine the terms and arrive at the simplified result of 0.",

By default deep is set to False.\nIf force is True then bases will be combined without checking for\nassumptions, e.g. sqrt(x)*sqrt(y) -> sqrt(x*y) which is not true\nif x and y are both negative.\nYou can make powsimp() only combine bases or only combine exponents by\nchanging combine='base' or combine='exp'.  By default, combine='all',\nwhich does both.  combine='base' will only combine::\na   a          a                          2x      x\nx * y  =>  (x*y)   as well as things like 2   =>  4\nand combine='exp' will only combine\na   b      (a + b)\nx * x  =>  x\ncombine='exp' will strictly only combine exponents in the way that used\nto be automatic.  Also use deep=True if you need the old behavior.\nWhen combine='all', 'exp' is evaluated first.  Consider the first\nexample below for when there could be an ambiguity relating to this.\nThis is done so things like the second example can be completely\ncombined.
