      "\t",
      "As pointed out by â€‹Haki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.",

If not, it returns an empty list.\nThen, it iterates through all the live receivers and calls each one, catching any exceptions that may be raised. The responses from the receivers, along with any exceptions, are collected in a list of tuples and returned.\nThis behavior seems to match the description in the Github issue, where it is mentioned that the `send_robust()` method does not log exceptions raised in the receivers. The issue suggests that it would be worth adding a `logger.exception()` call in the `except` clause to log these exceptions.\nFinal Answer:\nTo resolve the issue of missing log messages for exceptions raised in receivers of `Signal.send_robust()`, I propose the following solution:\n```python\nimport logging\ndef send_robust(self, sender, **named):\n\"\"\"\nSend signal from sender to all connected receivers catching errors.\nArguments:\nsender\nThe sender of the signal. Can be any Python object (normally one\nregistered with a connect if you actually want something to\noccur).\nnamed\nNamed arguments which will be passed to receivers.\nReturn a list of tuple pairs [(receiver, response), ... ].\nIf any receiver raises an error (specifically any subclass of\nException), return the error instance as the result for that receiver\nand log the exception using `logger.exception()`.\n\"\"\"\nif not self.receivers or self.sender_receivers_cache.get(sender) is NO_RECEIVERS:\nreturn []\nresponses = []\nfor receiver in self._live_receivers(sender):\ntry:\nresponse = receiver(signal=self, sender=sender, **named)\nexcept Exception as err:\nlogger.exception(\"Exception raised in Signal.send_robust() receiver: %s\", receiver)\nresponses.append((receiver, err))\nelse:\nresponses.append((receiver, response))\nreturn responses\n```\nThe changes made are:\n1. Imported the `logging` module to add logging functionality.\n2. Added a `logger.exception()` call inside the `except` clause to log the exception raised by the receiver.\nThis solution will ensure that any exceptions raised in the receivers of `Signal.send_robust()` are logged, making it easier for users to identify and troubleshoot issues.",
