The changes include:\n1. Importing `Number` and `MatrixExpr` for type checking.\n2. Replacing the problematic `S(item.args[0]).is_negative` check with a more robust type-based approach:\n- For `MatrixExpr` objects (which includes `MatrixSymbol`), it now uses the `could_extract_minus_sign()` method.\n- For `Number` objects, it uses the `is_negative` property.\n- For other types, it assumes they are not negative.\n3. If an item is negative, it now prints the negation of the item instead of the item itself.\nThese changes should resolve the issue with MatrixSymbols containing special characters in their names, while still correctly handling negative terms in the MatAdd expression. The modification has been successfully applied to the file, and the pretty printing of MatAdd objects should now work correctly for all cases, including those with MatrixSymbols that have special characters in their names.",

The method assumes that the first argument of the `MatAdd` object can be negative, and it adjusts the pretty-printed representation accordingly.\nHowever, in the case of the example where the `MatrixSymbol` has a trailing `*` in its name (`'y*'`), this assumption is causing an issue with the parsing and sympification of the expression, leading to a `SyntaxError`.\nTo resolve this issue, I propose the following solution:\n1. Modify the `_print_MatAdd` method to handle `MatAdd` objects more robustly, without making assumptions about the structure of the arguments.\n2. Ensure that the `MatrixSymbol` with a trailing `*` in the name is correctly parsed and sympified, without causing issues with the pretty printing.\nHere's an example of how the modified `_print_MatAdd` method could look like:\n```python\ndef _print_MatAdd(self, expr):\ns = None\nfor item in expr.args:\npform = self._print(item)\nif s is None:\ns = pform     # First element\nelse:\ns = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, ' + '))\ns = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, pform))\nreturn s\n```\nThis modified version of the `_print_MatAdd` method simply concatenates the pretty-printed representations of the `MatAdd` arguments, without making any assumptions about their structure. This should resolve the issue with the pretty printing of the `MatAdd` object in the provided example.",
