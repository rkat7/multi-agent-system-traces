      "The method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` can be significantly improved by using the **Knuth-Cohen bound** instead. After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\r",

The new functions `dup_zz_knuth_cohen_bound` and `dmp_zz_knuth_cohen_bound` have been added to the file. Additionally, we have updated the existing `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` functions to use the new Knuth-Cohen bound implementations.\nThese changes address the GitHub issue by replacing the Mignotte bound with the Knuth-Cohen bound, which is generally tighter and more efficient. The implementation follows the provided template and extends it to handle multivariate polynomials as well.\nTo complete this task, the following steps were taken:\n1. Added the `dup_zz_knuth_cohen_bound` function for univariate polynomials.\n2. Implemented the `dmp_zz_knuth_cohen_bound` function for multivariate polynomials.\n3. Updated the existing `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` functions to use the new Knuth-Cohen bound implementations.\nThese changes should significantly improve the polynomial factorization process in SymPy by using the more efficient Knuth-Cohen bound. The next steps would be to update any relevant tests and documentation to reflect these changes.",

Implement the Knuth-Cohen bound in SymPy by adding new functions `dup_zz_knuth_cohen_bound` and `dmp_zz_knuth_cohen_bound` to the `sympy/polys/factortools.py` file.\n2. Provide a comprehensive test suite to validate the correctness of the new Knuth-Cohen bound implementation.\n3. Compare the performance and accuracy of the new Knuth-Cohen bound implementation against the existing Mignotte bound implementation using the provided benchmarks.\n4. Submit a pull request to the SymPy project, providing the new Knuth-Cohen bound implementation, the test suite, and the performance comparison results.\n5. Work with the SymPy maintainers to get the new implementation reviewed and merged, replacing the existing Mignotte bound functions.\nThis approach will allow the SymPy project to evaluate the new Knuth-Cohen bound and potentially adopt it as the new standard for computing polynomial bounds in SymPy.",

This bound can be used to improve the efficiency of these algorithms.\nThe implementation of these functions suggests that they are used in the SymPy codebase for polynomial factorization, as evidenced by the surrounding code that calls `dmp_zz_factor` and `nextprime`.\nThe issue description mentions that the Knuth-Cohen bound can be used to improve the `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` function.

The changes include:\n1. Added import statements for `dup_zz_knuth_cohen_bound` and `dmp_zz_knuth_cohen_bound` at the beginning of the file.\n2. Replaced `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` with `dup_zz_knuth_cohen_bound` at line 733.\n3. Replaced `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` with `dmp_zz_knuth_cohen_bound` at line 735.\nThe updated functions now use the Knuth-Cohen bound, which provides a tighter estimate of the size of the factors of a polynomial, especially for polynomials with large coefficients.",
