In any of these cases, the method returns 0.\nSo in the case where `x = 1.5` and `Mod(x**2, x)` is evaluated, the condition `p.is_Pow and p.exp.is_Integer and p.base == q` is not satisfied, since `x**2` is not an integer power of `x`. Therefore, the `Mod` class does not return 0 in this case, and instead returns the actual modulo result of `0.75`.\nFinal Answer:\nThe issue with `Mod(x**2, x)` not always returning 0 is due to the implementation of the `eval` method in the `Mod` class in SymPy. The method checks for specific conditions where the modulo result can be determined to be 0, but the case where the base is a non-integer power is not explicitly handled. This leads to the observed behavior where `Mod(x**2, x)` returns 0 when `x` is an integer, but returns the actual modulo result when `x` is a non-integer.",
