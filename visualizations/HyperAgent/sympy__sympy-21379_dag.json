      "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions",
      "I am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r",

The `subs` method for the `Piecewise` class is implemented in the `_eval_subs` method.\n2. The method first collects the arguments (expressions and conditions) into a list, and then iterates through them to perform the substitutions.\n3. It keeps track of whether any of the conditions evaluate to `True` or `False` after the substitution. If all conditions evaluate to `False`, it returns `(Undefined, True)` as the new arguments.\n4. The method also tries to simplify the substituted expressions and conditions, by collapsing nested `Piecewise` expressions if the conditions match.\nThis implementation seems to handle the substitution of `Piecewise` expressions, including dealing with real assumptions and polynomial operations, as required by the original query.\nTo further investigate the issue described in the GitHub issue, I would need to look at the implementation of the `_intervals` method, which is responsible for determining the intervals in which the `Piecewise` expressions are defined.

The `_parallel_poly_from_expr` function in `sympy/polys/polytools.py` is responsible for handling polynomial operations on expressions, including `Piecewise` expressions.\n2. If a `Piecewise` object is encountered as a generator, the function raises a `PolynomialError` with the message \"Piecewise generators do not make sense\".\n3.
