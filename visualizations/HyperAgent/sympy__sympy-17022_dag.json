The `lambdify` function in the `utilities/lambdify.py` file is responsible for converting SymPy expressions into executable Python functions. It does this by generating a Python function string that uses the appropriate NumPy, SciPy, or other numeric functions based on the specified `modules` argument.\n2. The printing of SymPy expressions, including the `Identity(n)` function, is likely handled in the `printing` directory. The specific files that may be relevant are:\n- `ccode.py`: Handles the C-code printing of SymPy expressions.\n- `cxxcode.py`: Handles the C++-code printing of SymPy expressions.\n- `pycode.py`: Handles the Python-code printing of SymPy expressions.\n- `latex.py`: Handles the LaTeX printing of SymPy expressions.\nTo resolve the issue with the `lambdify` function misinterpreting the `Identity(n)` matrix expression, you should investigate the code in these files, particularly the printers that handle the printing of Matrix expressions.

It takes a SymPy expression and a set of variables as input.\n2. It generates a Python function that evaluates the expression using the specified variables.\n3. The generated function uses the namespaces of the specified modules (e.g. NumPy, SciPy) to replace SymPy functions and symbols with their numerical counterparts.\n4. It uses a special printer (defined in `sympy.printing.lambdarepr`) to convert the SymPy expression into a Python string that can be executed.\n5. It then uses `exec()` to create the Python function based on the generated string, and returns the function.\nRegarding the issue with the `Identity` matrix, the problem seems to be in how the `lambdify` function handles the printing and conversion of SymPy matrix expressions. The code that defines the printing behavior for the `Identity` matrix is likely located in the `sympy.printing.lambdarepr` module, which is used by `lambdify` to generate the Python function.\nTo resolve the issue, I would need to investigate the implementation of the `Identity` matrix printing in the `sympy.printing.lambdarepr` module, and see if there are any issues or edge cases that are not handled correctly when converting the `Identity` matrix to a Python function.",

If it is, we print it as a numpy identity matrix. If not, we fall back to the default printing. This ensures that the identity matrix is not misinterpreted as a complex number.\nNote that we also added checks for `expr.is_Symbol` and `expr.is_Add` to handle cases where the identity matrix is represented as a sum of symbols or a single symbol. This is because the `sp.eye` function can be represented in different ways in SymPy.",
