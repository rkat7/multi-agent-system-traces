It inherits from `FigureCanvasAgg`, `_macosx.FigureCanvas`, and `FigureCanvasBase`.\nThe `FigureManagerMac` class is the manager for the figure and canvas, and is responsible for handling the window, toolbar, and other high-level operations. It inherits from `_macosx.FigureManager` and `FigureManagerBase`.\nThese classes work together to provide the MacOSX-specific implementation of the figure and canvas functionality in Matplotlib.\nFinal Answer:\nThe issue with the DPI of the figure being doubled after unpickling on M1 Mac appears to be related to the behavior of the MacOSX backend in Matplotlib.\nThe key points are:\n1. The `FigureCanvasMac` class in the `backend_macosx.py` file is responsible for handling the figure and canvas for the MacOSX backend. It overrides the `resize` method to adjust the figure size based on the device pixel ratio.\n2. When a figure is unpickled, the `FigureCanvasMac` class is responsible for recreating the figure canvas. During this process, the `resize` method is called, which adjusts the figure size based on the device pixel ratio.\n3. The issue occurs because the device pixel ratio on the M1 Mac is different from the default DPI setting of the figure (which is 200 by default). This results in the figure being resized to a larger size, effectively doubling the DPI.\nTo mitigate this issue, you can try the following:\n1. Set the DPI of the figure explicitly before pickling it, to match the DPI of the display. For example:\n```python\nfig = plt.figure(dpi=self.figure.dpi)\n```\n2. After unpickling the figure, you can manually set the figure size to the desired size, bypassing the automatic resizing done by the `FigureCanvasMac` class:\n```python\nfig2 = pickle.load(blob)\nfig2.set_size_inches(fig.get_size_inches(), forward=False)\n```\nBy setting the DPI and size of the figure explicitly, you can ensure that the figure is not resized during the unpickling process, preventing the DPI doubling issue.",

To further investigate this issue, I would:\n1. Check if there are any open issues or discussions related to this problem in the Matplotlib GitHub repository.\n2. Look into the `__setstate__` method of the `Figure` class and the `FigureManagerMac` class to see if there are any potential issues with how the figure state is being restored.\n3. Consider reaching out to the Matplotlib development team to see if they are aware of this issue and if there is a known fix or workaround.\nFinal Answer: Based on the code exploration, the issue with the DPI doubling after unpickling on M1 Mac appears to be a specific bug in the Matplotlib backend for macOS. The code does not contain any obvious issues related to DPI setting, so further investigation into the Matplotlib codebase and discussions with the development team may be needed to understand and resolve this problem.",

The `resize` method of the `FigureCanvasMac` class:\n- This method deals with DPI scaling and device pixel ratio when resizing the figure.\n- It calculates a `scale` factor based on the figure's DPI and the device's pixel ratio, and then uses this to adjust the figure's size in inches.\n2. References to the `device_pixel_ratio` attribute:\n- The `device_pixel_ratio` attribute is used in the `resize` method to calculate the scaling factor.\nBased on this, it seems the MacOSX backend is aware of the device's pixel ratio and performs DPI scaling accordingly, particularly during figure resizing operations.\nFinal Answer:\nThe issue with the DPI of a figure being doubled after unpickling on an M1 Mac appears to be related to the behavior of the MacOSX backend in Matplotlib. Specifically:\n1. The `__setstate__` method of the `Figure` class in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` is responsible for restoring the figure from a pickled state. This method calls the `new_figure_manager_given_figure` function, which is likely responsible for creating a new figure manager and canvas for the restored figure.\n2. The `FigureCanvasMac` class in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py` is the canvas implementation for the MacOSX backend. This class has a `resize` method that deals with DPI scaling and device pixel ratio when resizing the figure.\n3. During the unpickling process, the `new_figure_manager_given_figure` function is called, which may be triggering the `resize` method of the `FigureCanvasMac` class. This could be causing the DPI to be doubled, as the `resize` method is designed to handle DPI scaling for the MacOSX platform.\nTo resolve this issue, a potential solution could be to modify the `new_figure_manager_given_figure` function or the `FigureCanvasMac` class to handle the DPI scaling correctly during the unpickling process, or to disable the DPI scaling behavior when restoring a figure from a pickled state.",

The `get_default_dpi()` method is not directly implemented in the `MacOSXFigureCanvasMacOSX` class or its parent classes. However, the DPI is set in the `__init__` method of the `FigureCanvasAgg` class, which is a parent class of `MacOSXFigureCanvasMacOSX`. The relevant code is:\n```python\ndef __init__(self, figure):\nsuper().__init__(figure)\nself._renderer = RendererAgg(w, h, self.figure.dpi)\nself._lastKey = key\n```\nThis suggests that the initial DPI setting for the `MacOSXFigureCanvasMacOSX` class is done in this `__init__` method, where it inherits the DPI from the `figure` object.\n2. The device scaling or pixel ratio is handled in the `resize` method of the `MacOSXFigureCanvasMacOSX` class. The relevant code is:\n```python\ndef resize(self, width, height):\n# Size from macOS is logical pixels, dpi is physical.\nscale = self.figure.dpi / self.device_pixel_ratio\nwidth /= scale\nheight /= scale\nself.figure.set_size_inches(width, height, forward=False)\nResizeEvent(\"resize_event\", self)._process()\nself.draw_idle()\n```\nThis code snippet is from `matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py`.\n3. The implementation of the `__init__` method for the `MacOSXFigureCanvasMacOSX` class is not directly shown in the provided code snippets. However, based on the inheritance hierarchy, it is likely that the `__init__` method is defined in the `FigureCanvasMac` class, which is a parent class of `MacOSXFigureCanvasMacOSX`. The relevant code is:\n```python\nclass FigureCanvasMac(FigureCanvasAgg, _macosx.FigureCanvas, FigureCanvasBase):\n# ...\ndef __init__(self, figure):\nsuper().__init__(figure=figure)\nself._draw_pending = False\nself._is_drawing = False\n```\nThis code snippet is from `matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py`.\nAs for the device scaling or pixel ratio for M1 Macs, it is handled in the `resize` method of the `MacOSXFigureCanvasMacOSX` class, as mentioned earlier. The relevant code is:\n```python\ndef resize(self, width, height):\n# Size from macOS is logical pixels, dpi is physical.\nscale = self.figure.dpi / self.device_pixel_ratio\nwidth /= scale\nheight /= scale\nself.figure.set_size_inches(width, height, forward=False)\nResizeEvent(\"resize_event\", self)._process()\nself.draw_idle()\n```\nThis code snippet is from `matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py`.",
