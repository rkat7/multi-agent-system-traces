It handles the formatting of the summation sign, the limits, and the function being summed over.\nThe main steps the function performs are:\n1. Extract the function being summed, the lower and upper limits of the summation.\n2. Create the pretty printed form of the function being summed.\n3. Determine the height and width requirements for the summation sign based on the height of the function and the limits.\n4. Create the pretty printed form of the summation sign and position it relative to the function.\n5. Combine the summation sign and the function into a single `prettyForm` object.\nTo resolve the issue with the misalignment of the `x` and `+ 3` terms, the `_print_Sum` function likely needs to be modified to handle the positioning of these elements more precisely.\nFinal Answer:\nThe issue with the misalignment of the `x` and `+ 3` terms in the pretty printed `Sum` expression is likely due to a limitation in the `_print_Sum` function in the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` file. This function is responsible for handling the pretty printing of `Sum` expressions in SymPy.\nTo resolve the issue, the `_print_Sum` function may need to be modified to improve the positioning and alignment of the different components of the expression. This could involve adjusting the spacing, baseline, or other formatting parameters to ensure the `x` and `+ 3` terms are properly aligned.",

To align them, we can use the `align` argument in the `pprint` function.

The `pprint` function in SymPy does not have a built-in way to align the terms in an expression. The `align` argument is used to align the output to the left, center, or right, but it does not align the terms within an expression.\nHere is the final answer:\n```\n<output>\n<verification_output>Sum(x, (x, 1, oo)) + 3</verification_output>\n</output>\n```\nThe `pprint` function in SymPy does not align the `x` and `+ 3` properly in the original code snippet.",
