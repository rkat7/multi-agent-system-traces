Sphinx's autodoc functionality tries to use the `__all__` attribute of a module to determine which members to document.\n2. If the `__all__` attribute is empty, raises an error, or contains an invalid value, Sphinx logs a warning and ignores the `__all__` attribute.\n3. As a result, even if `__all__` is empty, Sphinx will still document all the members of the module.\nThis suggests that the reported issue is likely a known behavior of the autodoc functionality, and the solution would be to ensure that the `__all__` attribute is correctly defined in the module, or to use the appropriate Sphinx options to control which members are documented.\nFinal Answer:\nThe reported issue, where Sphinx's autodoc functionality ignores an empty `__all__` attribute, is a known behavior in Sphinx. The relevant code is located in the `__init__.py` file of the `autodoc` module, where Sphinx attempts to retrieve the `__all__` attribute from the module being documented.\nIf the `__all__` attribute raises an error or contains an invalid value, Sphinx logs a warning and ignores the `__all__` attribute. As a result, even if `__all__` is defined as an empty list, Sphinx will still document all the members of the module.\nTo work around this issue, you have a few options:\n1. Ensure that the `__all__` attribute is correctly defined in the module, either as a list of strings or by using the `inspect.getall()` function.\n2. Use the Sphinx `exclude-members` option to explicitly exclude the members you don't want to be documented, regardless of the `__all__` attribute.\n3. Use the Sphinx `private-members` or `special-members` options to control which members are documented, regardless of the `__all__` attribute.\nBy using these Sphinx options, you can achieve the expected behavior of not documenting members when the `__all__` attribute is empty.",

The `__all__` attribute is initialized to `None` in the `__init__` method.\n2. In the `import_object` method, if the `ignore_module_all` option is not set, the extension attempts to set the `__all__` attribute by calling `inspect.getall(self.object)`.\n3. If the `__all__` attribute raises an `AttributeError` or contains an invalid value (not a list of strings), the extension logs a warning and ignores the `__all__` attribute.\nThis suggests that the issue with the empty `__all__` attribute being ignored is likely due to the way Sphinx's autodoc extension handles the `__all__` attribute.

Investigate if there are any known issues or discussions related to this behavior in the Sphinx project.\n2. Propose a potential solution or workaround to address the issue.\nFinal Answer:\nThe issue with the empty `__all__` attribute being ignored in the Sphinx autodoc extension is due to the way the extension handles the `__all__` attribute. The extension attempts to set the `__all__` attribute by calling `inspect.getall(self.object)`, but if the `__all__` attribute raises an `AttributeError` or contains an invalid value (not a list of strings), the extension logs a warning and ignores the `__all__` attribute.\nThis behavior does not properly handle the case where the `__all__` attribute is intentionally set to an empty list, which is the expected behavior in the provided example.\nTo address this issue, a potential solution would be to modify the Sphinx autodoc extension to treat an empty `__all__` attribute as a valid configuration and respect it, instead of ignoring it. This could be achieved by adding a check for an empty `__all__` list in the `import_object` method, and using that to filter the documented members instead of relying on the `inspect.getall(self.object)` call.\nHere's a high-level outline of the proposed solution:\n```python\n# in sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\ndef import_object(self, raiseerror: bool = False) -> bool:\nret = super().import_object(raiseerror)\ntry:\nif not self.options.ignore_module_all:\nself.__all__ = inspect.getall(self.object)\n# Check if __all__ is an empty list\nif self.__all__ == []:\n# Use the empty __all__ to filter the documented members\nself.member_name_filter = lambda name: name in self.__all__\nelse:\nself.member_name_filter = None\nexcept AttributeError as exc:\n# __all__ raises an error.\nlogger.warning(__('%s.__all__ raises an error. Ignored: %r'),\n(self.fullname, exc), type='autodoc')\nexcept ValueError as exc:\n# invalid __all__ found.\nlogger.warning(__('__all__ should be a list of strings, not %r '\n'(in module %s) -- ignoring __all__') %\n(exc.args[0], self.fullname), type='autodoc')\nreturn ret\n```\nThis solution checks if the `__all__` attribute is an empty list, and if so, uses it to filter the documented members instead of ignoring it. This should address the issue and provide the expected behavior when the `__all__` attribute is intentionally set to an empty list.",

The docstring has been updated to reflect the new behavior.\n2. The condition for checking the validity of `__all__` has been simplified.\n3. The comment explaining the new behavior has been added.\nThese changes should resolve the issue where an empty `__all__` attribute was being ignored. Now, if a module has an empty `__all__` list, it will be returned as an empty list instead of `None`, which should prevent autodoc from including all members when `__all__` is explicitly set to an empty list.\nFinal Answer: The `getall()` function in the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` file has been successfully modified to address the issue of empty `__all__` attributes being ignored. The changes ensure that:\n1. If a module has no `__all__` attribute, the function returns `None`.\n2. If a module has an empty `__all__` list, the function now returns that empty list instead of `None`.\n3. If a module has a non-empty `__all__` list (or tuple) containing only strings, it returns that list.\n4. For any other case (invalid `__all__`), it raises a `ValueError`.\nThese changes should resolve the GitHub issue where autodoc was ignoring empty `__all__` attributes and documenting all members instead. Now, when a module has an empty `__all__` list, autodoc should respect this and not document any members, as expected.\nTo fully resolve the issue, the Sphinx team should update their autodoc extension to handle the case of an empty list returned by `getall()` appropriately. They should ensure that when `getall()` returns an empty list, autodoc doesn't document any members of the module.",

With this change, the `Documenter` class should now correctly handle empty `__all__` attributes and not document any members when `__all__` is an empty list.\nThe Sphinx team should apply these changes to the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` file to resolve the issue where autodoc was ignoring empty `__all__` attributes and documenting all members instead of respecting the explicit empty list.",

With this change, the `Documenter` class should now correctly handle empty `__all__` attributes and not document any members when `__all__` is an empty list.\nThe Sphinx team should apply these changes to the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` file to resolve the issue where autodoc was ignoring empty `__all__` attributes and documenting all members instead of respecting the explicit empty list.",

It gathers all the members of the target object, including:\n- Attributes defined in the object's `__dict__`\n- Enum members\n- Members defined in `__slots__`\n- Other members found using `dir(subject)`\n- Annotated members (e.g., `attr: int`)\n2. It also checks the `ModuleAnalyzer` to find any instance attributes that were not already gathered.\n3. It returns a dictionary mapping member names to `Attribute` objects, which contain information about the member (name, whether it was directly defined, and the actual member object).\nSo this function is responsible for preparing the initial list of members that will be passed to the `filter_members` method for further processing.\nFinal Answer:\nThe key steps are:\n1. The `get_object_members` function in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc.importer` module gathers all the members of the object being documented, including those defined in `__all__`.\n2. The `Documenter.get_object_members` method calls `get_object_members` to obtain the list of members.\n3. If `self.options.members` is not empty, the `get_object_members` method filters the list of members to only include those specified in `self.options.members`.\n4. The filtered list of members is then passed to the `Documenter.filter_members` method, which applies additional filtering based on options like `private-members`, `special-members`, and `undoc-members`.\n5. If `self.options.ignore_module_all` is `False` (the default), the `Documenter.import_object` method sets `self.__all__` to the result of `inspect.getall(self.object)` before calling `filter_members`.\n6. The `filter_members` method then respects the `__all__` attribute when deciding which members to include in the documentation.\nSo in summary, Sphinx's autodoc extension respects the `__all__` attribute by first gathering all members, then filtering the list based on the `__all__` attribute and other configuration options. This ensures that an empty `__all__` list will result in no members being documented, as expected.",
