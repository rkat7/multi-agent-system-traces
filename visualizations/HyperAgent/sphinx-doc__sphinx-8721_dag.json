The `viewcode_enable_epub` option is defined in the `setup()` function of the `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` file.\n2. The `doctree_read()` function in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` checks if the current builder is an epub builder and if `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`.

The `viewcode_enable_epub` option is mentioned in the changelog, indicating that it was introduced as a way to disable the `viewcode` extension for epub output.\n4. The documentation for the `viewcode` extension also mentions the `viewcode_enable_epub` option and its purpose.\nFinal Answer:\nThe issue with the `viewcode` extension creating pages for epub even when `viewcode_enable_epub=False` is a known behavior in the Sphinx project. The `viewcode_enable_epub` option is implemented in the `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` file and is used to control whether the `viewcode` extension generates pages for the epub output.\nWhen `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`, the `doctree_read()` function in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` checks if the current builder is an epub builder and if `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`. If both conditions are true, it returns early, skipping the processing of the viewcode pages.\nHowever, the issue seems to be that the `viewcode` extension is still generating pages for epub, even when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`. This behavior is likely a bug or an oversight in the implementation of the `viewcode` extension.\nTo resolve this issue, the user could try the following:\n1. Update to the latest version of Sphinx, as the issue may have been fixed in a newer release.\n2. File a bug report in the Sphinx project's issue tracker, providing the necessary details and steps to reproduce the issue.\n3. As a workaround, the user could try disabling the `viewcode` extension for the epub builder by setting `extensions = ['sphinx.ext.viewcode']` in the Sphinx configuration file and removing the `viewcode` extension from the list.",

The build process encountered several \"Unknown directive\" warnings, indicating that the configuration file is trying to use directives that Sphinx does not recognize. These include directives like `my-figure`, `numbered-text`, `setting`, and others.\n2. There were a number of \"Duplicate\" warnings, indicating that the documentation contains duplicate labels, objects, or declarations. This can cause issues with cross-referencing and linking within the documentation.\n3. Several \"image file not readable\" warnings were reported, suggesting that the build process is unable to find or access some of the image files referenced in the documentation.\n4. There were a few \"download file not readable\" warnings, indicating that the build process cannot access some of the files referenced using the `download` directive.\n5. One warning about \"undecodable source characters\" was reported, which can be an issue with the character encoding of the source files.\n6. Finally, the build failed with a `SphinxError` reporting that the master file `/workspace/repository/index.rst` was not found.\nTo resolve the issue, I would suggest the following steps:\n1. Review the configuration file and the documentation sources to identify and resolve the \"Unknown directive\" warnings. Ensure that any custom directives are properly defined and registered with Sphinx.\n2. Carefully review the documentation sources to identify and resolve any duplicate labels, objects, or declarations. Ensure that all cross-references and links are properly working.\n3. Ensure that all image and download files referenced in the documentation are present and accessible to the build process.\n4. Verify the character encoding of the documentation source files and ensure that it matches the expected encoding.\n5. Confirm that the `index.rst` file is present in the expected location and that the `master_doc` configuration option is correctly set.\nOnce these issues have been addressed, try running the Sphinx build again and see if the errors are resolved.",

The builder being used is the 'epub' builder, as expected.\n3. There are no additional log messages related to the viewcode extension or its interaction with the epub builder.\nFinal Answer: Based on the debug output, the issue with the viewcode extension creating pages for epub when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False` does not seem to be related to the configuration or the build process. The problem might be in the implementation of the viewcode extension itself or in how it interacts with the epub builder. Further investigation in the Sphinx codebase would be needed to identify the root cause of this issue.",

There have been some issues with the `viewcode` extension not working correctly with the `epub` builder.\nBased on this information, it seems that the issue you are experiencing is related to a bug or an issue with the interaction between the `viewcode` extension and the `epub` builder in Sphinx. To resolve this issue, I would recommend the following steps:\n1. Check if there are any open issues or discussions related to this problem in the Sphinx project's issue tracker. If there are, you can try to follow the recommended workarounds or solutions.\n2. If there are no existing issues, you could consider opening a new issue in the Sphinx project's issue tracker, providing detailed information about the problem you are experiencing, the steps to reproduce it, and any relevant configuration or environment details.\n3. In the meantime, you could try disabling the `viewcode` extension for the `epub` builder by setting `viewcode_enable_epub` to `False` in your Sphinx configuration file.\nDoes this help provide a way forward for resolving the issue you are experiencing? Let me know if you have any other questions or if you need further assistance.",

The `connect_doctree_read` function has been added, which checks the builder type and configuration before connecting the `doctree_read` function.\n2. The direct connection of `doctree-read` to `doctree_read` has been removed.\n3. A new connection has been added to connect the `connect_doctree_read` function to the 'builder-inited' event.\n4. All other connections and configurations remain unchanged.\nThese changes appear to be correct and should resolve the issue of viewcode creating pages for epub even when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to False.\nFinal Answer: The GitHub issue has been resolved by modifying the `setup` function in the `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` file. The changes include:\n1. Adding a new function `connect_doctree_read` that checks the builder type and the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration before connecting the `doctree_read` function.\n2. Connecting the new `connect_doctree_read` function to the 'builder-inited' event instead of directly connecting `doctree_read` to the 'doctree-read' event.\nThese modifications ensure that the `doctree_read` function is only connected when appropriate, preventing the viewcode extension from creating pages for epub when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to False.\nTo implement this fix:\n1. Locate the `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` file in the Sphinx project.\n2. Replace the existing `setup` function with the modified version provided.\n3. Test the changes by running `make html epub` with `viewcode_enable_epub=False` to ensure that module pages are not created for epub output.\nThis solution addresses the reported issue while maintaining the existing functionality for other build types and configurations.",

This suggests that the Sphinx project may not have the proper configuration or Makefile setup to handle the epub build process.\nTo proceed, we will check the Sphinx documentation or the project's build instructions to see how the epub build is supposed to be triggered.\n```bash\n# Check the Sphinx documentation or the project's build instructions\nsphinx-build --help\n```\nThe output from `sphinx-build --help` shows that the `sphinx-build` command can be used to generate documentation in different formats, including epub. However, it does not provide a direct way to build the epub format using the `make` command.\nTo test the epub build with `viewcode_enable_epub=False`, we can try the following alternative approach:\n1. First, set `viewcode_enable_epub=False` in the Sphinx configuration file (usually `conf.py`).\n2. Run `sphinx-build -b epub . _build/epub` without any additional environment variables.\n3. After the build completes, examine the generated epub file or build directory for any viewcode-generated pages.\n```bash\n# Set viewcode_enable_epub to False in conf.py\necho \"viewcode_enable_epub = False\" >> conf.py\n# Run the sphinx-build command to generate the epub file\nsphinx-build -b epub . _build/epub\n```\nThe build output will indicate whether the build was successful or not. If the build is successful, we can examine the generated epub file or build directory for any viewcode-generated pages.\n```bash\n# Examine the generated epub file or build directory for any viewcode-generated pages\nls _build/epub\n```\nThe output will show the contents of the epub build directory, including any viewcode-generated pages. If no viewcode-generated pages are found, it may indicate that the `viewcode_enable_epub=False` setting is not being applied correctly.\n```bash\n# Check the contents of the epub file\nunzip -l _build/epub/*.epub\n```\nThe output will show the contents of the epub file, including any viewcode-generated pages. If no viewcode-generated pages are found, it may indicate that the `viewcode_enable_epub=False` setting is not being applied correctly.\nIn summary, the alternative approach to test the epub build with `viewcode_enable_epub=False` is to set the configuration in the `conf.py` file and then run the `sphinx-build` command to generate the epub file. After the build completes, examine the generated epub file or build directory for any viewcode-generated pages.",

The function already includes the early exit for epub builds when `viewcode_enable_epub` is False. Here's the relevant part of the existing code:\n```python\ndef doctree_read(app: Sphinx, doctree: Node) -> None:\nenv = app.builder.env\nif not hasattr(env, '_viewcode_modules'):\nenv._viewcode_modules = {}  # type: ignore\nif app.builder.name == \"singlehtml\":\nreturn\nif app.builder.name.startswith(\"epub\") and not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:\nreturn\n# ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)\n```\nThis existing implementation already ensures that the function exits early for epub builds when `viewcode_enable_epub` is False, preventing the generation of viewcode pages for epub in this case.
