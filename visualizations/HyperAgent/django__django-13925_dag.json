This suggests that the `speedycore` package is likely a separate project or application that is integrated with the Django project.\n2. The `settings.py` file is not located in the main Django codebase. It is likely located in the project-specific directory, which is not included in this repository.\n3. The `AppConfig` classes mentioned in the warning messages (e.g., `SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig`) are also not present in the main Django codebase. They are likely defined in the `speedycore` package or the project-specific code.\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the issue is related to the project-specific configuration and models, rather than the core Django codebase. To resolve this issue, we will need to focus on the project-specific code and settings, rather than the Django source code.\nThe steps to resolve the issue would be:\n1. Locate the project-specific `settings.py` file and update the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting to use `'django.db.models.BigAutoField'`.\n2. Locate the `AppConfig` classes mentioned in the warning messages (e.g., `SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig`) and remove the `default_auto_field` attribute.\n3. Review the model definitions in the project-specific code and ensure that any models that inherit from other models are using `BigAutoField` for the primary key field.\n4. Run the migrations again and verify that the warnings are resolved.\nWithout access to the project-specific code and configuration, I cannot provide the exact code changes required. However, the general approach would be to focus on the project-specific settings and models, rather than the core Django codebase.",
