VISUAL EXAMPLES EXPLAINED - Real Visualizations from Your Data
================================================================================

Let me walk you through ACTUAL examples from the visualizations we just created,
using plain language and real file names you can open right now.

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 1: A Simple Math Problem (AG2)
================================================================================

FILE TO OPEN: ag2_output/bb32247c-aef8-5366-8d9c-1ac7e032b48f_human_timeline.png

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
- 4 horizontal bars (4 turns in the conversation)
- Bars alternate red-blue-red-blue (back and forth conversation)
- All bars roughly same length (balanced conversation)
- No diamonds (no code used, just plain reasoning)

WHAT HAPPENED (The Story):
1. Red bar (Turn 1): Math teacher asks student to solve a problem
2. Blue bar (Turn 2): Student solves it correctly
3. Red bar (Turn 3): Teacher says "continue if you need to"
4. Blue bar (Turn 4): Student confirms the answer is correct ✓

RESULT: Problem solved in just 4 turns! Quick and efficient.

WHY THIS IS GOOD:
- Short (only 4 turns)
- Balanced (both agents participated equally)
- Successful (got the right answer)
- No failures detected (see the failures.png - mostly green bars!)

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 2: A Frustrating Math Problem (AG2)
================================================================================

FILE TO OPEN: ag2_output/02da9c1f-7c36-5739-b723-33a7d4f8e7e7_human_timeline.png

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
- 10 horizontal bars (much longer conversation)
- Pattern: red-blue-red-blue-red-blue... keeps repeating
- Blue bars get shorter and shorter (student running out of things to say)
- Red bars stay similar (teacher keeps saying the same thing)

WHAT HAPPENED (The Story):
1. Teacher: "Solve this: How many inches of ribbon per gift bow?"
2. Student: "I can't! You didn't tell me how much total ribbon there is!"
3. Teacher: "Just keep trying!"
4. Student: "Seriously, I need the total ribbon amount..."
5. Teacher: "Keep trying!"
6. Student: "This is impossible without that information..."
7. Teacher: "Keep trying!"
8. Student: "I CAN'T without the data..."
9. Teacher: "Keep trying!"
10. Student: "Fine. Answer is: DATA INSUFFICIENT" ✓

RESULT: Correct answer, but took 10 turns (2.5x longer than necessary)

WHY THIS IS BAD:
- Too long (10 turns for a simple realization)
- Repetitive (teacher kept saying same thing)
- Frustrating (student was RIGHT from turn 2, but had to keep arguing)

NOW LOOK AT THE FAILURES FILE:
ag2_output/02da9c1f-7c36-5739-b723-33a7d4f8e7e7_human_failures.png

You'll see RED bars for:
- "Unaware of stopping conditions" - YES! Teacher didn't know when to stop
- "Ignoring good suggestions from other agent" - YES! Teacher ignored student

Perfect example of AI communication breakdown!

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 3: Spotify Library Cleanup (AppWorld)
================================================================================

FILE TO OPEN: appworld_output/aa8502b_1_hierarchy.png

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
- 3 circles (nodes): Supervisor, Spotify, API
- Arrows connecting them
- Red circle (Supervisor) in center
- Green circle (Spotify)
- Other colors for supporting agents

WHAT HAPPENED (The Story):
User asked: "Clean up my Spotify - keep only liked/downloaded songs"

The hierarchy shows:
                    Supervisor (red)
                    /            \
            Spotify Agent      API Docs
                    
This means:
- Supervisor received the task
- Supervisor delegated to Spotify Agent (the expert)
- Spotify Agent used API Docs to figure out which buttons to press

NOW LOOK AT THE TIMELINE:
appworld_output/aa8502b_1_timeline.png

You'll see ~20 events in sequence:
1. Supervisor thinking
2. Entering Spotify Agent
3. Spotify asks for login
4. Supervisor gets password
5. Spotify logs in
6. Spotify checks library
7. ... and so on

Like watching a task flow through a company!

NOW LOOK AT API USAGE:
appworld_output/aa8502b_1_api_usage.png

You'll see bars for:
- supervisor.show_account_passwords: 2x (had to look up password twice)
- spotify.login: 1x (logged in once)
- spotify.show_library: 3x (checked library multiple times)

WHY: The AI had to look up credentials, log in, then explore the library
to figure out which songs to keep/remove.

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 4: Fixing a Flask Bug (HyperAgent)
================================================================================

FILE TO OPEN: hyperagent_output/pallets__flask-5063_human_overview.png

WHAT YOU'LL SEE (Left pie chart):
- Big slice for "tool_call" (most time spent using tools)
- Medium slice for "navigator" (searching for code)
- Smaller slices for other activities

WHAT YOU'LL SEE (Right bar chart):
- "Tool" has the biggest bar (lots of tool usage)
- "Navigator" has second biggest
- "Planner" has smaller bar

WHAT HAPPENED (The Story):
Bug report: "Flask app routing is broken"

The AI team:
1. Planner: "Let's find the routing code"
2. Navigator: Searches through 50+ files
3. Navigator: "Found it! It's in routing.py line 342"
4. Editor: Opens file, makes fix
5. Navigator: Checks if fix looks good

RESULT: 128 total events, 37 tool calls to find and fix ONE bug!

NOW LOOK AT TOOLS:
hyperagent_output/pallets__flask-5063_human_tools.png

You'll see:
- open_file: 15 times (opened lots of files)
- keyword_search: 10 times (searched for specific code)
- get_folder_structure: 5 times (explored directories)
- editor: 3 times (made 3 edits)

WHY SO MANY?: Code debugging is like finding a needle in a haystack!
Had to search through many files before finding the right place to fix.

NOW LOOK AT FAILURES:
hyperagent_output/pallets__flask-5063_human_failures.png

RED bars show:
- "No attempt to verify outcome" - Made changes but didn't test them!
- "Derailing from task objectives" - Got distracted by other code
- "Step repetition" - Searched same files multiple times

This is why debugging AI is still not perfect - it doesn't always test its fixes!

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 5: Comparing All Three (Unified)
================================================================================

FILE TO OPEN: unified_output/comparison.png

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
Four bar charts, each comparing ag2, appworld, hyperagent

CHART 1 (Top-Left): Average Trajectory Length
- ag2: ~6 bars (short)
- appworld: ~34 bars (medium)
- hyperagent: ~128 bars (TALL!)

INTERPRETATION: Debugging code (hyperagent) takes 20x more steps than
solving a math problem (ag2)!

CHART 2 (Top-Right): Average Tool/API Usage
- ag2: ~1 bar (minimal tools)
- appworld: ~10 bars (medium tool usage)
- hyperagent: ~26 bars (LOTS of tools!)

INTERPRETATION: Code debugging requires way more "actions" than other tasks.

CHART 3 (Bottom-Left): Average Failure Modes
- ag2: ~1 bar
- appworld: ~0 bars (no failures tracked for this system)
- hyperagent: ~2.2 bars (most failures)

INTERPRETATION: More complex tasks = more ways to fail

CHART 4 (Bottom-Right): Just shows we analyzed 5 traces from each

KEY INSIGHT FROM THIS CHART:
If tasks were races:
- AG2 = Sprint (short and fast)
- AppWorld = Middle distance (moderate)
- HyperAgent = Ultra-marathon (long and complex)

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 6: What Mistakes Happen Most Often?
================================================================================

FILE TO OPEN: unified_output/ag2_failure_patterns.png

This analyzed 20 DIFFERENT math problems to find patterns.

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
Long list of possible mistakes, with bars showing frequency.

LONGEST BARS (Most Common Mistakes):
1. "Unaware of stopping conditions" - Happens ~8 times out of 20
   Translation: AI doesn't know when to quit trying
   
2. "Ignoring good suggestions from other agent" - ~6 times out of 20
   Translation: One AI ignores the other's correct advice
   
3. "Step repetition" - ~5 times out of 20
   Translation: Doing the same thing over and over

SHORTEST BARS (Rare Mistakes):
- "Invented content" - Almost never happens
- "Blurring roles" - Rarely happens

INTERPRETATION: AG2's biggest weakness is knowing when to stop!

NOW COMPARE TO HYPERAGENT:
FILE TO OPEN: unified_output/hyperagent_failure_patterns.png

LONGEST BARS (Most Common Mistakes):
1. "No attempt to verify outcome" - Happens ~10 times out of 20!
   Translation: AI fixes code but doesn't test if it works
   
2. "Derailing from task objectives" - ~6 times out of 20
   Translation: Gets distracted by wrong parts of code
   
3. "Step repetition" - ~5 times out of 20
   Translation: Keeps searching the same files

INTERPRETATION: HyperAgent's biggest weakness is not testing its work!

THIS IS SUPER USEFUL because now researchers know what to fix first:
- For AG2: Teach it when to stop
- For HyperAgent: Teach it to verify changes

================================================================================
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
================================================================================

When you look at ANY visualization, ask yourself:

1. LENGTH
   - Short bars/few turns = Efficient (good)
   - Long bars/many turns = Inefficient or complex (depends)

2. BALANCE
   - Equal-sized bars = Balanced teamwork (good)
   - One huge bar = One agent dominated (could be bad)

3. PATTERNS
   - Smooth progression = Organized work (good)
   - Chaotic/repetitive = Disorganized (bad)

4. COLORS
   - Mostly green in failures = Few problems (good)
   - Lots of red in failures = Many problems (bad)

5. TOOL USAGE
   - Varied tools = Thorough exploration (good)
   - Same tool repeatedly = Stuck in a loop (bad)

================================================================================

ANSWERS:
1. 4 bars, alternating red-blue, quick
2. (You tell me! Look at the tallest bar)
3. Usually open_file, then keyword_search (lots of reading)
4. HyperAgent for all three (it's the most complex)
