## 🎓 Key Concepts (In 30 Seconds)

**What's a "trace"?**
A record of what an AI system did. Like a transcript.

**What's a "trajectory"?**
The path the AI took to solve a problem. Like a journey.

**What's an "agent"?**
One AI worker in a team. Like a team member.

**What's a "failure mode"?**
A type of mistake the AI can make. Like common errors.

**What's a "tool"?**
An action the AI can perform. Like opening a file.
