Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
Courtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number. However, Kelly went to the same concert and said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number of people in attendance by 20%. If Kelly was right, 40 people really attended the concert. What was the audience size according to Courtney?</data>

      <data key="d4">assistant</data>
      <data key="d5">First, the key idea here is calculating the actual audience size given Courtney’s initial report and the percent error reported by Kelly. We need to figure out a 20% reduced audience size from Courtney's statement.

Let’s denote Courtney’s estimation as C and the real audience number as R. Based on the problem, we know C = 48 and C = R + 20% of R. Solving for R will give us the real audience number according to Kelly.

In Python code, we can solve for R using sympy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics.

```python
import sympy as sp

C = 48  # Courtney's estimation
R = sp.Symbol('R')  # real audience number

# equation using the information given by Kelly
equation = sp.Eq(C, R + 0.2 * R)

real_audience = sp.solve(equation, R)[0]
print(f"The real audience was: {real_audience}")
```

We subtract the estimated audience size from the real audience size to find the number of people Courtney overstated.

```python
overstated = C - real_audience
print(f"The number of people Courtney overstated is: {overstated}")
```

Follow these steps and adjust the code as necessary based on the results.</data>

      <data key="d5">Great! The result matches our expectation.

Courtney had initially reported an audience size of 48, but Kelly corrected her saying that she had overstated the size by 20%. We calculated and found out that there were indeed 40 people in attendance. Courtney had overstated the number of people by 8.

So, the final answer is \boxed{8}.</data>
