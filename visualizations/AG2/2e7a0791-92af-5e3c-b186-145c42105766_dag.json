      "Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and did 500 steps going shopping. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?"

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day.

We know that he did half of these on his walks to and from school, so therefore, he did 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps on his school walk. We also know he did 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and 500 steps going shopping. By subtracting the steps he had taken from the total (10,000 - 5,000 - 1,000 - 500), we will get the steps taken during the jog and using the remaining steps after the jog, we will get the steps taken during the jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the calculated steps before the jog.\n\nLet's put this logic in a Python code.",
