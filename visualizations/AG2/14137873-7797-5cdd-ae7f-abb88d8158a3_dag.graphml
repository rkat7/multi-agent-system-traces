Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
Dave purchased a big packet of french fries and consumed fourteen before a ravenous seagull snatched the packet from his grasp. Upon landing, the seagull devoured half the quantity of french fries that Dave had consumed. Subsequently, three pigeons chased him away from the meal, and each pigeon consumed three fries. Later, a raccoon pilfered two thirds of the remaining fries. A single french fry was then carried away by ants, leaving only five behind. What was the initial quantity of french fries in the packet that Dave purchased?</data>

We can solve this problem by working backwards from the end to the beginning, going step by step opposite to the order of the problem statement.

Case 1:

Let's write a Python code to solve it. First take the number of french fries left after the ants, then reverse every event to get the initial quantity of french fries. 

We need to reverse the following events:
- ants carrying one french fry away,
- raccoon pilfering two thirds of remaining fries,
- each pigeon eating three fries,
- seagull eating half the quantity of fries that Dave had initially,
- Dave consuming fourteen fries.

```python
from sympy import *

# start with the number of fries left after the ants
fries = 5

# reverse the ants carrying away one french fry
fries += 1

# reverse the raccoon taking two thirds of the fries
fries = fries/(1 - 2/3)

# reverse the pigeons eating three fries each
fries += 3*3

# reverse the seagull eating half the fries Dave had
fries = fries*2

# reverse Dave eating fourteen fries
fries += 14

print(fries)
