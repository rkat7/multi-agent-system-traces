You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nReggie, Lynn, and Paisley ran together. Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. How many miles did Lynn run?",

However, we can calculate how many miles Reggie ran based on the information given.\n\nKey Idea: We can use Python to calculate how many miles Reggie ran by multiplying the distance Paisley ran by 5.\n\n```python\n# declare the distance Paisley ran\nPaisley_miles = 4\n\n# calculate the distance Reggie ran\nReggie_miles = Paisley_miles * 5\n\n# print the result\nprint(f\"Reggie ran {Reggie_miles} miles.\")\n```\nYou can run this code to find out how many miles Reggie ran.
