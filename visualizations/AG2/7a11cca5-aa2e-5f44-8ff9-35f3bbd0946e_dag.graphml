      <data key="d5">Let's use Python to solve a math problem.

Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
The amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases on the third day so that the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons, calculate the increase amount in the third day.</data>

      <data key="d4">assistant</data>
      <data key="d5">Key Idea: The problem can be solved using simple arithmetic calculations.

The first day's amount of water is stated to be 4000 gallons.
On the second day, this volume doubles, providing us 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.
The question states the total volume of water on the third day is 14000 gallons.

Subtracting the total amount from the previous two days from the total amount on the third day gives the increase in the volume of water on the third day.

Let's code this step-by-step:

```python
# Volume of water on first day
first_day_volume = 4000

# Volume of water on second day (doubled)
second_day_volume = first_day_volume * 2

# Total volume on third day
third_day_total_volume = 14000

# To find the increase on the third day, subtract the total amount of previous two days from 
# the total amount of the third day
third_day_increase = third_day_total_volume - (first_day_volume + second_day_volume)

print(third_day_increase)
```

After running this code, you will receive the final increase in the volume of water on the third day. Remember to insert it into the \boxed{} result format.</data>
