      "James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 30-mile lake.  He can swim at a pace of 3 miles per hour.  He swims 70% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 30-mile lake.

Calculate the time to swim 70% of the lake.\n2. Calculate the rest time, which is half of the swimming time.\n3. Calculate the time to swim the remaining 30% of the lake at half speed.\n4. Add up all the times to get the total time.\n\nNow we'll write the solution in Python.",
