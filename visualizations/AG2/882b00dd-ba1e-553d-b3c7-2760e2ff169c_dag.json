      "When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was. After two months of employment, Sally's salary was $0.5 more per hour than brfore. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?"

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours.\n    * Billy had a starting rate of $10, a raise of $0.50 after 2 months and another raise of $1 after a year. Since the problem does not specify the exact time frame after which we are comparing Billy's and Sally's earnings, let's assume it is after one year when Billy's hourly rate reaches $11.50 (10 + 0.5 + 1).\n2. Calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours.\n    * Sally starts with $10.50 per hour (0.5 more than Billy's starting salary) and has a raise of $0.50 after 2 months. So, if we also consider the period to be one year, her total rate will be $11.00 (10.5 + 0.5).\n3. Calculate the difference between Billy's and Sally's total earnings.\n\nLet's write Python code for the calculations: \n\n\\begin{verbatim}\n# your code\n\\end{verbatim}",
