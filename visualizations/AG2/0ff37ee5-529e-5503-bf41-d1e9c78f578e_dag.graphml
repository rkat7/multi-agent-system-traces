      <data key="d5">Let's use Python to solve a math problem.

Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
Ali has some $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. If Ali has $32 after buying the dinner, how many $10 bills does Ali have originally?</data>

      <data key="d5">Sure, to solve this problem, we can start by understanding the relationship between the different amounts of money and use it to develop an equation.

The key idea here is:

1. Ali initially has some amount of money, say "T".
2. This total consist of money from $10 bills, say "x" and money from six $20 bills.
3. He gives half of T to his sister which leaves him with 1/2 T.
4. He uses 3/5 of what is left (1/2 T) to buy dinner, leaving him with (1/5)(1/2 T).
5. If this remaining amount of money equals $32, we can form an equation and using it to find the value of "x".

Let's implement this idea in Python.</data>

      <data key="d4">assistant</data>
      <data key="d5">Alright, let's continue with the calculation. For the money from the $10 bills, let's assume he has "x" number of them. Therefore, the total money Ali has at first ("T") would be:

T = 10x (for x $10 bills) + 6*20 (for 6 $20 bills)

After giving her sister half of the total money, the remaining money is:

1/2 T

Then he spends 3/5 of this amount to buy dinner. The remaining money is:

(1/5)(1/2)T OR (1/10)T

According to the problem, Ali has $32 left after buying the dinner. We then have the following equation:

(1/10)T = 32

Plug in the value of T from the first equation into the second equation to solve for x. Implementing this in Python code:</data>

      <data key="d5">```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# declare x as a symbol
x = symbols('x')

# Initial total money is from $10 bills (10*x) and six $20 bills
T = 10*x + 6*20

# After giving half to his sister and spending 3/5 of the remaining for dinner, Ali has $32 left
# Therefore, (1/10)T = 32
equation = Eq((1/10)*T, 32)

# Solve the equation for x
solution = solve(equation, x)

# print the solution
print('The number of $10 bills that Ali originally has is: ', solution[0])
```

This Python code will solve the equation and give us the number of $10 bills that Ali originally has.</data>
