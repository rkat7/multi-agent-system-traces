You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

This is done by summing up the time he spent boating, swimming and watching shows which is given to be 30% of his total time. Then we can find out how much time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of his total time.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total time John spent on his vacation.\nFrom the problem, we know that John spent 60 hours boating, half that time swimming, and the time he also watched 30 shows which were 20 hours each. Sum these time durations.\n\nStep 2: Find out that this time is 30% of his total time. So using this information, we calculate the total time John spent on his vacation.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the time John spent sightseeing which was 40% of his total time.\n\nNow let's write Python code to find out the answer.",
