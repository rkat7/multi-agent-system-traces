You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nErica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out.

The main point is to calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica made and received, and then subtract from this number the quantity she gave out. \n\nLet's represent this problem with a Python program. To solve this scenario, we don't need any package but the Python built-in functions.\n\n```python\n# number of cards made by Erica\ncards_made = 20\n\n# number of cards brought by her dad\ncards_from_dad = 2 * 30 # assuming there are 30 cards in a box as mentioned in the problem\n\n# total number of cards before given out\ntotal_cards = cards_made + cards_from_dad \n\n# number of cards given out\ncards_given_out = 24 + 5\n\n# number of cards received from others \ncards_received = 17\n\n# final number of cards she has now\nfinal_cards = total_cards - cards_given_out + cards_received \n\nprint(final_cards)\n```",
