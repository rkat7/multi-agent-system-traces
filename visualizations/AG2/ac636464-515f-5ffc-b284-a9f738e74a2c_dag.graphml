Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 30-mile lake.  He can swim at a pace of 3 miles per hour.  He swims 70% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?</data>

      <data key="d3">user</data>
      <data key="d4">assistant</data>
      <data key="d5">Key Idea: Here we need to calculate total time taken by James to cross the lake. This total time includes the time he took while swimming, while resting and finally while covering the remaining distance. 

It's possible to solve this problem directly using Python. 

Let's break the problem down:

1. Calculate the time to swim 70% of the lake.
2. Calculate the rest time, which is half of the swimming time.
3. Calculate the time to swim the remaining 30% of the lake at half speed.
4. Add up all the times to get the total time.

Now we'll write the solution in Python.</data>

      <data key="d5">Sure. Here is the Python code to calculate the total time taken by James to cross the lake.

```python
from sympy import *

# distance
d_total = 30  # total distance in miles
d_70 = 0.7 * d_total  # 70% of the total distance in miles
d_30 = 0.3 * d_total  # 30% of the total distance in miles

# speed
s_full = 3  # full speed in miles per hour
s_half = 0.5 * s_full  # half speed in miles per hour

# time to swim 70% of the lake
t_swim_70 = d_70 / s_full

# rest time
t_rest = 0.5 * t_swim_70

# time to swim the remaining 30% of the lake at half speed
t_swim_30 = d_30 / s_half

# total time
t_total = t_swim_70 + t_rest + t_swim_30

print(t_total)
```

Please run the Python code to get the result.</data>
