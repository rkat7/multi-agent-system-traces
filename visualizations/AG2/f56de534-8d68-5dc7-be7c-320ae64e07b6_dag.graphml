Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
Johnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces, and anther one that had 125 pieces than the 500 piece one.  How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?</data>

      <data key="d5">The key to solve this problem is to calculate the number of lego pieces in each set and then add them up.

The first lego set has 500 pieces.
The second one has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it would contain 3 * 500 pieces.
The third one has 1/4 the number of pieces in the first one, so it would contain 500 / 4 pieces.
The last one has 125 more pieces than the first one so it would be 500 + 125 pieces.

By adding these up we will get the solution.

Here is the Python code to calculate the total number of lego pieces.

```python
# First Lego Set
first_set = 500

# Second Lego Set
second_set = 3 * first_set

# Third Lego Set
third_set = first_set / 4

# Fourth Lego Set
fourth_set = first_set + 125

# Total number of Lego Pieces
total_pieces = first_set + second_set + third_set + fourth_set

print(total_pieces)
