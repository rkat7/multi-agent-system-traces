      <data key="d5">Let's use Python to solve a math problem.

Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
Miss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. Miss Maria is going to give her sister Jane 10 cards, but Jane refuses. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?</data>

      <data key="d2">1</data>
      <data key="d3">user</data>
      <data key="d4">assistant</data>
      <data key="d5">Key Idea: To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has initially. Then, subtract the number of cards that Miss Maria kept and the number Jane refused to get the number of cards given to students. Finally, we divide this by the number of cards each student received to get the number of students.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the total number of cards
total_basketball_cards = 6 * 25
total_baseball_cards = 5 * 40
total_cards = total_basketball_cards + total_baseball_cards

# Step 2: Subtract the cards Miss Maria kept and Jane refused
cards_after_jane_refusal = total_cards - 10
cards_given_to_students = cards_after_jane_refusal - 50

# Step 3: Determine the number of students
num_students = cards_given_to_students / 10

# Output the result
print(num_students)
```</data>
