Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
The Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. How many eggs did the friends find?</data>

      <data key="d5">The key to solve this problem is to understand it correctly. It states that the Smith twins each found 30 eggs. Which means total eggs found by the Smith twins will be 2*30. The rest of the eggs, aside from 10, were found by their friends. Hence, we need to subtract the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining 10 eggs from the total number of eggs to find the number of eggs found by friends.

Let's write a program to solve the problem.

Case 1:

```python
# number of eggs found by each of the Smith twins
eggs_found_by_each_twin = 30 

# total number of eggs found by the Smith twins
total_eggs_found_by_smith_twins = 2 * eggs_found_by_each_twin 

# number of eggs remaining
remaining_eggs = 10 

# Let's assume 'E' is the total number of Easter eggs initially hidden.
# According to the problem, we know that:
# E (total eggs) = eggs found by Smith twins + eggs found by friends + remaining eggs
# Re-arranging this, we get the number of eggs found by friends as:
# eggs found by friends = E - (eggs found by Smith twins + remaining eggs)

# So we need to find 'E'. But if you look at the problem, it says all the other eggs (E) except 10 were found by their friends.
# So we can write eggs found by friends = E - 10.

# Hence we equate the two equations and solve for E

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

E = symbols('E')

eq1 = Eq(E - (total_eggs_found_by_smith_twins + remaining_eggs), E - 10) 

sol = solve(eq1, E) 

print("Total number of eggs =", sol[0])

# Calculating the eggs found by friends
eggs_found_by_friends = sol[0] - (total_eggs_found_by_smith_twins + remaining_eggs)

print("Eggs found by friends =", eggs_found_by_friends)

      <data key="d5">I apologize for the confusion. Let's analyze the problem again. There seems to be a misunderstanding. Given:

1. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, hence the twins together found 2*30 = 60 eggs.
2. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends.

This implies that all the eggs, except for 70 (60 from the twins and 10 that were not found), were found by their friends. So, we directly have our answer without needing to set an equation for total eggs initially hidden. Let's modify the code based on this understanding:

Case 1:
```python
# number of eggs found by each of the Smith twins
eggs_found_by_each_twin = 30 
# total number of eggs found by the Smith twins
total_eggs_found_by_smith_twins = 2 * eggs_found_by_each_twin 

# number of eggs remaining
remaining_eggs = 10 

# calculating the eggs found by friends
eggs_found_by_friends = total_eggs_found_by_smith_twins + remaining_eggs

print("Eggs found by friends =", eggs_found_by_friends)
```
According to above code, the number of eggs found by friends is simply the sum of the eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining eggs.
Once you've run the Python code, it should provide you with the correct number of eggs found by the friends.</data>
