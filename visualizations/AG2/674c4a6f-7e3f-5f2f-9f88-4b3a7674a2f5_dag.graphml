Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
To have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 85 or higher in his math class. His math grade is calculated by the average of 5 test scores. On those tests, he received: 70, 95, 88, 90 and 78. What is his current math grade?</data>

      <data key="d5">Key Idea: The math grade is calculated by the average of 5 test scores. We can calculate this by summing all the scores and then dividing by the number of tests.

Now I will write a Python program to solve it.

```python
from sympy import *

# define the test scores
scores = [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]

# calculate the average
average = sum(scores) / len(scores)

# output the average
print(average)

      <data key="d5">So, Wilson's current math grade is 84.2, which is below 85. Therefore, \boxed{he will not have the car for the weekend}.</data>
