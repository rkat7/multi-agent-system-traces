Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. He also wants to make a duvet cover, 9 feet long and 11 feet wide. How many square feet of fabric does Jim need to buy?</data>

      <data key="d5">Key Idea:
The problem can be solved by calculating the area of the fabric required for the comforter and duvet cover individually and then adding these two results together.

Solution:
Firstly, we calculate the area of fabric required for the comforter which needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the area of the comforter will be (6+2) * (8+2) square feet.
Secondly, we calculate the area of fabric required for the duvet cover. The area of the duvet cover is 9 * 11 square feet.
Lastly, we add these two area results to get the total area of fabric required for both comforter and duvet cover.

The steps above can be solved using Python directly. Let's write the code.

```python
# Required packages
from sympy import *

# Dimensions of the bed
length_bed = 6
width_bed = 8

# Dimensions of the duvet cover
length_duvet = 9
width_duvet = 11

# Additional feet for the comforter
extra_feet = 2

# Calculate the area of fabric required for the comforter
area_comforter = (length_bed + extra_feet) * (width_bed + extra_feet)

# Calculate the area of fabric required for the duvet cover
area_duvet = length_duvet * width_duvet

# Calculate the total area of fabric required
total_area = area_comforter + area_duvet

print(total_area)
```

The output will be the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy.</data>
