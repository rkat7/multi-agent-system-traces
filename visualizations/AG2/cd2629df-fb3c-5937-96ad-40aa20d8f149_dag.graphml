Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. To make things more interesting, he decided to pay her back in a unique way. For 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month, even though he also spends $50 on his hobby of collecting rare coins each month. On the twelfth month, he will pay the remaining amount, including the interest, and also plans to buy a coin worth $100. How much will Stephen pay his sister in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases?</data>

      <data key="d5">The key to solving this problem is to calculate:
1. How much Stephen gives to his sister over the course of the 11 months.
2. How much he still owes his sister after 11 months.
3. The interest on the remaining debt, which will be the 2% of the remaining debt.
4. The total amount he will pay in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases.

      <data key="d4">assistant</data>
      <data key="d5">Sure, let's begin.

First, find out how much Stephen gives his sister over the course of the 11 months. 

```python
months = 11
monthly_payment = 25

total_payment = months * monthly_payment
print(total_payment)
```

Second, subtract the total payment from the $300 to find out how much he still owes his sister after 11 months.

```python
initial_borrowed_amount = 300

remaining_debt = initial_borrowed_amount - total_payment
print(remaining_debt)
```

Third, calculate the interest on the remaining debt, which will be 2% of the remaining debt.

```python
interest_rate = 0.02

interest = remaining_debt * interest_rate
print(interest)
```

Finally, add the remaining debt and the interest to find out the total amount he will pay on the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases.

```python
twelfth_month_payment = remaining_debt + interest
print(twelfth_month_payment)
