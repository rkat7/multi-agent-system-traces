Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
To kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.  They fill up several packs of balloons that have 30 balloons per pack.  By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.  How many balloons did they throw?</data>

      <data key="d3">user</data>
      <data key="d4">assistant</data>
      <data key="d5">Key Idea: To find the number of balloons thrown, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they had.

Case 1: This problem can be solved with Python code directly.

The problem did not specify how many packs of balloons they filled up. Let's assume they filled up 'n' packs. We need to multiply the number of packs 'n' by the number of balloons per pack (30) to find the total number of balloons. Then, we need to subtract the number of balloons left (12) from the total.

```python
# your code
n = 10  # assuming they filled up 10 packs
balloons_per_pack = 30
left_balloons = 12

total_balloons = n * balloons_per_pack
thrown_balloons = total_balloons - left_balloons

print(thrown_balloons)
```

Please run this code with the actual number of packs 'n'. If the number of packs is not known, this problem can't be solved.</data>
